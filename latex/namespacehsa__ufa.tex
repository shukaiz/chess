\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a re-\/implementation of the old hsa console by Holt Software Associates. Re-\/done from scratch in Swing with much code imported from the old hsa console. The main goals were to reduce screen flicker during animations and eliminate a couple of small bugs in the input routines. April 30, 2010.

Differences from hsa console\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Row \& Column for text start at 0, 0
\item When creating console, specify width, height in pixels (not rows, columns)
\item set\+Color sets the drawing color for print and println as well as graphics
\item set\+Text\+Background\+Color no longer works. Use set\+Background\+Color instead.
\item use get\+Draw\+Height() and get\+Draw\+Width() for screen size in pixels
\item no more read\+String. Use read\+Token or read\+Line instead.
\item no more read\+Char. Use get\+Char instead.
\item methods added to poll the keyboard state without pausing the program (ket\+Key\+Char, get\+Key\+Code, get\+Last\+Key\+Char, etc.). Good for live-\/action games.
\item dropped support for print, quit, save buttons.
\item fixed draw\+Image to be more reliable
\item added mouse listener code

See Console.\+java for differences between this version and the old one.

Update August 2012\+: Changed synchronization to synchronize on the associated \mbox{\hyperlink{classhsa__ufa_1_1_console}{Console}} object. Now application writers can also synchronize on the \mbox{\hyperlink{classhsa__ufa_1_1_console}{Console}} object to kill the last remaining cases of screen flicker.

Update September 2014\+: Fixed bug in get\+Row() and get\+Column(); they now report the current cursor position without requiring a print() first.
